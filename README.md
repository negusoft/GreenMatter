**IMPORTANT!!!!**

**THIS LIB DOESN'T WORK ON ANDROID MARSHMALLOW (6.0+) AND ITS USE IS DISCOURAGED!**

More precisely, the color overriding at runtime is not working. There is no fix found at the moment. The future of the library is uncertain, although it might be forked to become an enhancement to the material theme backport (without the color overriding feature).

The project is in early development stage but the core functionality is already available. See the 'Getting Started' for more information.
